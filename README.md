## GL NLP Midterm Project
### Fake News Detection using LSTMs May 2023

This project uses the LSTM Neural Network architecture from Sequential Deep Learning to effectively distinguish Fake News articles from real ones in the WELFake dataset, which can be challenging to accomplish without automated mechanisms given how closely fake news can mimic real articles. Detecting and combating fake news is increasingly becoming a necessity and a crucial part of the strategy of digital and social media platforms that aim to give their users the best possible experience.
